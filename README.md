# About

This is the source code for ComeBackSunday.

ComeBackSunday is a mental-health-forward social media platform designed to organically gather social media use to one, dedicated day of the week, freeing you up to live the other six.

On ComeBackSunday, posting opens as soon as it becomes Sunday anywhere on earth, and closes when it is no longer Sunday anywhere on earth.

After posting closes, you are free to _look_ at your feed throughout the week, but you can rest assured that there won't be any new additions until next Sunday!

# Code

This is a Python web application written in Django. It is currently hosted on PythonAnywhere.

- A [diagram](notesPostsApp.pdf) presents a high-level overview of the system design.
- A [markdown file](notes/notes.md) notes future improvements.
